    "In this project, we will be working with local game data from UBC (University of British Columbia), called PLAIcraft, ran by a group of people in the department of Computer Science. This project aims to conver analysis and modelling of the data, visualizing it graphically to predict any correlations between any variables used. The data consists of two files: Project_Planning_Players.csv and Sessions.  This project will only require the Players data.  "
