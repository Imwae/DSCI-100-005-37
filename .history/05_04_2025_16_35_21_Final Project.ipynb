    "# Predicting Experience Level Using Age and Hours Played\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be working with local game data collected from a virtual world called PLAIcraft, which is run by a Computer Science research group at UBC, led by Frank Wood. PLAIcraft’s primary goal is “to create an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that can act in a human-like way in a simulated setting” (PLAI, 2025). The data consists of two files: `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`; however, the aim of our analysis only requires the use of `players.csv`. This project aims to confer analysis and modelling of the data, as well as visualizing it graphically to predict any correlations between the variables used. The researchers want to determine what kind of players contribute a significant amount of data so they can target these players during their recruiting efforts. To explore this research goal, we will investigate whether age and playing hours can be used to predict the experience level of a player. The relationship between the variables (experience level, age, and playing hours) will help identify highly engaged players who are more likely to contribute the most data. The analysis of highly engaged players can help the researchers understand player behaviour, which will be used to “train and develop an advanced AI” (PLAI, 2025) that can interact in PLAIcraft more naturally. \n",

    "The dataset consisted of 196 players categorized into five experience levels: Amateur, Veteran, Regular, Beginner, and Pro. Most of the players are amateurs, and the pro players are the rarest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model achieved the highest cross-validation accuracy (approximately 29.8%) with K = 3.\n",
    "K=3. However, the testing accuracy was only 30%, indicating lower prediction reliability.\n",
    "The model showed low precision and recall in its prediction as well. This meant the model frequently assigned wrong experience levels to players while it also could not find the correct skilled players. For instance, we see that Pro players were often confused as beginners, while many amateur players received incorrect Veteran labels.\n",
    "The confusion matrix revealed that the model struggled to distinguish between experience levels.\n",
    "#### Expectations:\n",
    "The low accuracy suggests that the data with age and hours played can not only predict experience levels with reliability. This aligns with the lack of clear patterns in the scatter plot (Figure 2), where no strong relationship between age, playtime, and experience was seen.\n",
    "We expected some correlation between them, but the results show that other factors might help more with prediction or can help increase prediction reliability.\n",
    "#### Impact:\n",
    "These findings show the need to collect additional variables to improve predictions.\n",
    "The low accuracy results suggest that targeting players based only on age and playtime may not effectively provide the answer/results we are looking for. Instead, a more refined approach might be needed.\n",
    "#### Possible future questions:\n",
    "Will using a different classification style give better results?\n",
    "How do player behaviors (other than the data we have about their behavior) impact experience levels?\n",
    "Could including other variables improve the model/result?\n",
