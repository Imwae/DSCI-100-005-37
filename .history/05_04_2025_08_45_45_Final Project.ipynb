    "# Predicting Experience Level Using Age and Hours Played\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be working with local game data collected from a virtual world called PLAIcraft, which is run by a Computer Science research group at UBC, led by Frank Wood. PLAIcraft’s primary goal is “to create an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that can act in a human-like way in a simulated setting” (PLAI, 2025). The data consists of two files: `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`; however, the aim of our analysis only requires the use of `players.csv`. This project aims to confer analysis and modelling of the data, as well as visualizing it graphically to predict any correlations between the variables used. The researchers want to determine what kind of players contribute a significant amount of data so they can target these players during their recruiting efforts. To explore this research goal, we will investigate whether age and playing hours can be used to predict the experience level of a player. The relationship between the variables (experience level, age, and playing hours) will help identify highly engaged players who are more likely to contribute the most data. The analysis of highly engaged players can help the researchers understand player behaviour, which will be used to “train and develop an advanced AI” (PLAI, 2025) that can interact in PLAIcraft more naturally. \n",
